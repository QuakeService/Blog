Using regression testing tools is essential to establishing an efficient and dependable workflow that detects bugs and issues at an early stage. These specialized tools automate the repetitive and time-consuming tasks involved in regression testing, enabling teams to concentrate on software development while ensuring quality.

In this article, we will delve into regression testing tools, acquainting you with the most popular and pertinent choices and examining their features, limitations, and pricing.

What is regression testing?

Regression testing is a crucial stage in the software development process that is performed following any modifications to ensure that the changes have not inadvertently introduced any issues or caused the reoccurrence of previously fixed bugs.

The primary objective of regression testing is to address a common concern faced by developers, which is the reappearance of bugs that were previously resolved when new changes are incorporated. Without a robust version control system, it becomes difficult to pinpoint which specific alteration led to a particular bug.

By conducting comprehensive regression testing, this risk can be mitigated, and the overall stability of the project can be maintained. It is highly recommended to integrate regression testing as a standard practice to ensure the quality and reliability of the software.


What areas require regression testing?

The following areas should be considered for automation in regression testing:

●	Latest code changes: Automate tests for the code that has been recently introduced or modified to ensure that it functions correctly and does not impact existing functionalities.

●	Potentially affected areas: Identify and automate tests for areas of the software that are likely to be affected by the changes. This helps ensure that any regressions or unintended consequences are caught early.

●	High-risk test cases: Automate test cases that are considered too risky to be left untested. These may involve critical functionalities or areas that have a history of being prone to issues.

●	Environment-dependent test cases: Automate tests that rely on specific execution environments, such as different browsers, operating systems, or configurations. This ensures consistent and reliable testing across different environments.

●	End-to-end business-critical scenarios: Automate test cases that cover end-to-end business-critical scenarios. These tests validate the overall functionality and integration of the software from a user's perspective.

However, it is important to note that automation alone cannot discover bugs in unexplored areas of the software. The effectiveness of regression testing largely depends on selecting the right test cases for automation, which varies based on the specific reasons for conducting regression testing.

While Selenium is suitable for automating functional and regression testing, it requires coding skills, test suite setup, and an automation ecosystem, which can involve significant time and effort. Considering the tedious and time-consuming nature of automating regression procedures, alternative tools to Selenium may be considered for easier handling of new and existing code.


How do I perform Regression Testing?

The process of performing regression testing can be approached in the following manner:

In Agile environments, where software is released iteratively and frequently, a collaboration between Developers and Testers is emphasized. This collaborative environment facilitates testers' understanding of which tests may be impacted and which areas require testing. Regular releases to the testing environment ensure thorough testing of the software. As the product evolves and becomes more complex, the regression testing coverage expands accordingly.

Considering the iterative nature of regression tests, automation is highly recommended. There is insufficient time between cycles to manually test all the existing features.

Manual execution of test cases is not only laborious but also increases the duration of test execution, necessitates more resources, and proves costly. Agile methodologies prioritize delivering high-quality software within short timeframes. Lengthening release cycles to incorporate extensive regression testing coverage is not feasible. Therefore, automating regression tests is the most effective approach.

How do I choose a regression tool?

When choosing a regression testing automation tool, it's important to consider specific criteria that align with your project requirements. Once you've determined that the project's duration and scope warrant the upfront effort of setting up automation, focus on key features in an automation tool that satisfy your needs.

During the evaluation process, take into account the following factors:

●	Rapid and effortless script development and maintenance.
●	User-friendly test execution for non-technical users.
●	Integration with Continuous Integration tools like TFS DevOps for streamlined build and deployment processes.
●	Support for cross-browser and cross-platform testing across various environments (mobile, desktop, web).
●	Capability for keyword- and data-driven testing.
●	Reliability, maintainability, and scalability of the tool.
●	End-to-end QA lifecycle management, encompassing test generation and comprehensive reporting.
●	Availability of technical support, including customer service, a knowledge base, and an active community.

By considering these criteria, you can make an informed decision when selecting the most suitable regression testing automation tool for your project.

Checklist for Selecting an Automated Regression Testing Tool:

●	Easy test authoring: Look for a tool that simplifies test script development, such as scriptless automation testing tools that use natural language to write complex automated tests.

●	Run tests after every build: The tool should support running regression tests for every code modification, allowing immediate verification of changes and the ability to revert to previous versions if needed.

●	Quick actionable feedback: Seek automated regression testing tools that provide fast feedback to enable effective release decisions and timely issue resolution.

●	Parallel execution for time-saving: Ensure the tool can schedule and execute tests in multiple environments simultaneously, saving execution time and accommodating variables sensitive to different environments.

●	Test case prioritization: Look for tools that allow prioritization of test cases (high, medium, low) to communicate the order of execution and adjust the order or category if necessary.

●	Identifying affected tests: The tool should assist in identifying relevant test cases affected by code changes, reducing the need to re-run the entire test suite.

●	Easy maintenance: Choose a tool that facilitates test maintenance after application changes, automatically adjusting tests to fit the modifications, and providing ease of editing or modifying test cases.

●	Collaboration support: Ensure the tool allows for easy collaboration among team members, facilitating communication, sharing updates, and providing actionable feedback on regression test status to foster effective collaboration between QA teams and developers.

Best Practices for Automated Regression Testing:

●	Plan your QA strategy: Allocate sufficient time for testing in the product lifecycle, determine the role of QA in the process, and consider available resources. Define the scope of testing and the testing strategy to be employed, such as which user stories will be tested and what types of tests will be conducted.

●	Identify test cases for the automation: Select test cases that are repetitive, required for multiple builds, difficult to perform manually, prone to human errors, involve multiple data sets, or are time-consuming when executed manually. These are the ideal candidates for automation.

●	Test early and frequently: Catching bugs early in the development process minimizes their impact on the project. Conduct regular regression tests throughout development to identify and address issues as early as possible, reducing costs and saving time on fixing defects.

●	Foster collaboration between development and QA teams: Ensure seamless coordination and communication between the automation and development teams. This collaboration helps reduce churn, minimize miscommunications, and enhance the overall efficiency of the development cycle.

●	Create quality test data: Use external data sources to create reusable and easily maintainable automated tests. By utilizing test data files, you can add new testing scenarios without modifying the actual test script, making test maintenance more efficient.

●	Develop tests resistant to UI changes: Build automated tests in a way that minimizes reliance on specific UI elements' locations or coordinates. Instead, use unique names or identifiers for controls, allowing the creation of stable test scripts that can withstand UI changes without breaking.

●	Coordinate development and QA cycles: Coordinate the timing of testing with the development cycle. It is often effective to conduct testing one sprint behind the development phase. This lag allows for a more stable codebase and reduces the risk of automation scripts breaking due to frequent code changes.
